# Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

## Overview
This repository contains implementations and explanations of fundamental statistical concepts, including point estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The code is designed to help understand and apply these concepts using Python.

## Features
### Point Estimation and Confidence Intervals
- Compute and interpret a point estimate of a population mean.
- Construct and interpret confidence intervals for a population mean and proportion.
- Determine the required sample size for estimating population parameters.
- Adjust confidence intervals for finite populations.

### Hypothesis Testing
- Understand the process of hypothesis testing.
- Apply a six-step procedure for testing hypotheses.
- Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed hypothesis tests.
- Conduct hypothesis tests for population means.
- Compute and interpret p-values.
- Use the t-statistic for hypothesis testing.
- Compute the probability of a Type II error.

### Comparing Population Means
- Test hypotheses about the equality of two independent population means.
- Perform hypothesis tests for dependent (paired) samples.
- Explain the difference between independent and dependent samples.

### Variance and ANOVA
- Apply the F-distribution to test equality of two population variances.
- Conduct ANOVA to test equality of three or more population means.
- Use confidence intervals to interpret differences between population means.
- Incorporate blocking variables in two-way ANOVA.
- Perform a two-way ANOVA with interaction effects.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
